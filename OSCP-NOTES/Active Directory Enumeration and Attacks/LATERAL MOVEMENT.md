 there are several ways we can move laterally. Typically, if we take over an account with local admin rights over a host, or set of hosts, we can perform a `Pass-the-Hash` attack to authenticate via the SMB protocol

*But what if we don't yet have local admin rights on any hosts in the domain?*

There are several other ways we can move around a Windows domain:

- `Remote Desktop Protocol` (`RDP`) - is a remote access/management protocol that gives us GUI access to a target host
- [PowerShell Remoting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/ps101/08-powershell-remoting?view=powershell-7.2) - also referred to as PSRemoting or Windows Remote Management (WinRM) access, is a remote access protocol that allows us to run commands or enter an interactive command-line session on a remote host using PowerShell
- `MSSQL Server` - an account with sysadmin privileges on an SQL Server instance can log into the instance remotely and execute queries against the database. This access can be used to run operating system commands in the context of the SQL Server service account through various methods
