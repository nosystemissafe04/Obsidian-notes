**POINTS TO LOOK FOR IN THIS PHASE**

- AD Users - enumerate valid user accounts we can target for password spraying 

- AD Joined Computers - computers including *domain controllers* , *file servers* , *SQL Servers* , *web servers* , *mail servers* , *database servers*

- key services - kerberos , Netbios , LDAP , DNS

- vulnerable hosts and services - anything that can be quick win ( an esy host to exploit and gain foothold)

**FOR INITIALS WE DID MONITOR NETWORK TRAFFIC TO GET TO KNOW ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPEININNG WE FOUND ARP AND MDNS PACKETS , WE FOUND SOME HOST**

USED TOOLS HERE 
- TCPDUMP
- WIRESHARK (GUI)
- NET-CREDS 
- NETMINER
- PKTMON.EXE(WINDOWS 10 BUILTIN)

AND THE ONE WHICH I DIDNT EXPECT TO SEE HERE **RESPONDER** TO ANALYZE NETWORK TRAFFIC 

[Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder-Windows) is a tool built to listen, analyze, and poison `LLMNR`, `NBT-NS`, and `MDNS` requests and responses.

```BASH
sudo responder -I ens224 -A
```

**PINGING ACTIVE HOST ON THE NETWORK WITH FPING**

Where fping shines is in its ability to issue ICMP packets against a list of multiple hosts at once and its scriptability. Also, it works in a round-robin fashion, querying hosts in a cyclical manner instead of waiting for multiple requests to a single host to return before moving on.

Here we'll start `fping` with a few flags: `a` to show targets that are alive, `s` to print stats at the end of the scan, `g` to generate a target list from the CIDR network, and `q` to not show per-target results.

```BASH
fping -asgq 172.16.5.0/23
```

 We can combine the successful results and the information we gleaned from our passive checks into a list for a more detailed scan with Nmap

**NMAP SCANNING**
 it would be wise of us to focus on standard protocols typically seen accompanying AD services, such as DNS, SMB, LDAP, and Kerberos name a few. Below is a quick example of a simple Nmap scan.

```BASH
sudo nmap -v -A -iL hosts.txt -oN /home/htb-student/Documents/host-enum
```
