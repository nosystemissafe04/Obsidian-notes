## What is DCSync and How Does it Work?

DCSync is a technique for stealing the Active Directory password database by using the built-in `Directory Replication Service Remote Protocol`, which is used by Domain Controllers to replicate domain data. This allows an attacker to mimic a Domain Controller to retrieve user NTLM password hashes.

The crux of the attack is requesting a Domain Controller to replicate passwords via the `DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All` extended right. This is an extended access control right within AD, which allows for the replication of secret data.

To perform this attack, you must have control over an account that has the rights to perform domain replication (a user with the Replicating Directory Changes and Replicating Directory Changes All permissions set). Domain/Enterprise Admins and default domain administrators have this right by default.

#### Using Get-DomainUser to View adunn's Group Membership

```powershell
Get-DomainUser -Identity adunn |select samaccountname,objectsid,memberof,useraccountcontrol |fl
```

#### Using Get-ObjectAcl to Check adunn's Replication Rights

```powershell
$sid= "S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1164"

Get-ObjectAcl "DC=inlanefreight,DC=local" -ResolveGUIDs | ? { ($_.ObjectAceType -match 'Replication-Get')} | ?{$_.SecurityIdentifier -match $sid} |select AceQualifier, ObjectDN, ActiveDirectoryRights,SecurityIdentifier,ObjectAceType | fl
```
 
 We first get the user's SID in the above command and then check all ACLs set on the domain object (`"DC=inlanefreight,DC=local"`) using [Get-ObjectAcl](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Get-DomainObjectAcl/) to get the ACLs associated with the object. Here we search specifically for replication rights and check if our user `adunn` (denoted in the below command as `$sid`) possesses these rights.

*If we had certain rights over the user (such as [WriteDacl](https://bloodhound.specterops.io/resources/edges/write-dacl)), we could also add this privilege to a user under our control, execute the DCSync attack, and then remove the privileges to attempt to cover our tracks. DCSync replication can be performed using tools such as Mimikatz, Invoke-DCSync, and Impacket’s secretsdump.py. Let's see a few quick examples.*

#### Extracting NTLM Hashes and Kerberos Keys Using secretsdump.py

Running the tool as below will write all hashes to files with the prefix `inlanefreight_hashes`. The `-just-dc` flag tells the tool to extract NTLM hashes and Kerberos keys from the NTDS file.
